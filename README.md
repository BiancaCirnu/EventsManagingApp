Events Managing Application

The application can be started as admin or as a user, having information stored in textfiles.

The **admin** can add, remove or modify events. When adding an event, all the introduced data is checked if it fits some requirements.

The **user** can see all events or the ones happening in a specified month and they can also have their own list of events to which they want to attend. 

Project done in my Object Oriented Programming class, in the second semester as a Computer Science student at Babes Bolyai University.
